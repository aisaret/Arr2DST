# Arr2DST
Project for study only

This is a basic Arr2D (beginner book reference) example.

This example image is a simple arr2.

This is working on my secret project. In creating 2D cryptography variables, hackers cannot directly find the exact value.
To use it, declare Array2D_ST and define parameters and the rest of the functions you have to encode manually.

# new features Array2D_ST
 complex encryption
 Reduce problems when operating system files is large, causing the program to crash.
 
Made for educational purposes and to build on my project only.
